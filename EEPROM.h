 * Description: This file contains the program to demonstrate the Internal Memory Storage. 

This code has been developed and tested on CloudX microcontroller boards.  
We strongly believe that the library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. 
Check this link http://www.makeelectronics.ng for awesome tutorials on CloudX,ARM,Robotics,RTOS,IOT.
ByteHub Embedded invests substantial time and effort developing open source HW and SW tools,
to support consider buying the CloudX microcontroller boards.
